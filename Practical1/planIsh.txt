plot1:
d is set to 0.2
y-axis: number of evaluations
x-axis: m values. For each value of m (1,2,4,8,16) plot the value for each run + the avg
			the averages are the main point->connected by lines


plot2:
same as plot1 but d=0.8


plot3:
d=0.2
gets average from using all m values
y = #evaluations
x = populationSize

plot4:
same as plot3 but d=0.8


plot5/6 etc?
y=evals
x=population
set m to only 1 value.


plot 7: as table
y = number of optimals found
x = pop size / 


in each graph:
	one plot for OnePoint crossover
	one plot for uniform crossover
 

use tables for std.


!!!! in all plots: when using #evaluations, this is the number of evaluations when finding
	the optimal solution. All 1s.

do some tests with k=3 (maybe k=10) to get some feel for what k affects??
